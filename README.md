# Flow Control

Using React Flow to create a flow control application, primarily for designing, architecting, and visualizing the systems and processes of a business.

## Getting up and running

Install the javascript dependencies:

```bash
npm install # or `pnpm install` or `yarn install`
```

Install the python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the python server:

```bash
python -m server.server
```

Run the javascript development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building the app
To build the app, run the following vs code task (reccomended):
```
Build App
```
The executable will be in the `dist` folder, along with all required files.

## Customizing the app:

- Create a new custom node inside `src/custom/` 
- Change how things look by [overriding some of the built-in classes](https://reactflow.dev/learn/customization/theming#overriding-built-in-classes).
- Add a layouting library to [position your nodes automatically](https://reactflow.dev/learn/layouting/layouting)
