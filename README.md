# Flow Control

Using React Flow to create a flow control application, primarily for designing, architecting, and visualizing the systems and processes of a business.

## Getting up and running

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install # or `pnpm install` or `yarn install`
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Customizing the app:

- Create a new custom node inside `src/custom/` 
- Change how things look by [overriding some of the built-in classes](https://reactflow.dev/learn/customization/theming#overriding-built-in-classes).
- Add a layouting library to [position your nodes automatically](https://reactflow.dev/learn/layouting/layouting)
